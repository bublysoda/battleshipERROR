This is the unfinished version of my Battleship project for ToP.

CURRENT ISSUE:  I am getting an error in my part3.js file that is meant to handle
all my event listeners (since part 2 might get flooded with DOM stuff).  It says that
"
ReferenceError: placeShip is not defined
    at part3.js:5:1
"
which is weird considering I exported it.  Can someone help me out?
